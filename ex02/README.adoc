== Creating Ratpack projects with Lazybones and running them with Gradle and as standalone JAR (10 minutes)

https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones] is a scaffolding tool to generate application skeletons for different projects, and it's the recommended option for bootstrapping a Ratpack application.

Letâ€™s create a Ratpack project in the current directory:

 lazybones create ratpack . 

After that, you can run the application with Gradle:

 ./gradlew run

=== Examining the project layout (5 minutes)

Once you have created the app, let's have a look at it's content:

* `build.gradle` is the main Gradle build file.
* `src/main/groovy` is the package root for your Groovy classes (as in all Gradle/Maven applications).
* `src/ratpack` contains Ratpack specific artifacts. The most important one is `Ratpack.groovy` which contains the Ratpack DSL. If you take a look at it, you will find it similar to the script we created in the previous exercise.
* `src/test/groovy` will contain your Spock tests.

=== Generating a standalone fat JAR (5 minutes)

The `build.gradle` file generated by Lazybones comes with the Shadow plugin preinstalled, which will allow you to generate a standalone fat JAR.

To do so:

 ./gradlew shadowJar

Then, you can run it by simply executing:

 java -jar build/libs/*-all.jar
